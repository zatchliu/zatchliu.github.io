The purpose of this project was to create an anaytical drawing of an existing lighting system. The drawing would capture as thoroughly as possible the range of visual, material, scalar, electrical, and mechanical conditions of the assembly.

This lighting system that We chose was a standard table lamp. This kind of lamp would usually be found in a household setting such as in a living room or on a bedside nightstand.

The Final drawing

The pinup mainly focuses on the parts, mechanisms, functionality, and other physical
properties of the lamp. The lamp teardown on the left side of the pinup showcases all the main
components of the lamp and gives a sense of how the lamp is assembled. For some parts in the
teardown, important details such as material or functionality were included to give some insight
to certain design choices of the lamp. For example, the lamp shade has a layer of plastic and
linen that helps diffuse the light and give it an interesting texture. A closer zoom in of the lamp
socket and the intricate components housed within was also included. This was done mainly to
illustrate the functionality of the lamp switch. When we were disassembling the lamps, the
socket components slipped and fell out of the housing, so we weren’t able to record the exact
order of the components. However, through trial and error and speculation, we were able to glean
the general assembly and functionality of the components. One thing I found interesting was how
the main barrel has three notches that appear to catch on the copper leaves, thus allowing the
lamps to have different light settings as you turn the knob.

One thing I think we struggled with was conveying the evocation of the lamp’s design and the
relationship it has with its environment. We did note that this lamp would typically be inside in a
household setting, such as on a nightstand or in a living room. Furthermore, the minimal and
modern design was difficult to unpack through drawings. I was curious about how these design
choices impacted its environment. Given the contemporary design of the lamp, I think it’s
probably on the newer side. Nowadays, I feel that furniture choices in a house are subjective to
its residents, so the environment this lamp was in was probably dependent on the tastes of its
owner. However, the simplistic and neutral design also makes the lamp feel very versatile; it
could fit in many different interior styles. Overall, I think creating the analytical drawing was
effective for understanding the mechanisms of a simple lighting system, and it gave me an
appreciation for the complexities of a common piece of furniture that we usually take for
granted.
