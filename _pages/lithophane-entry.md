The main purpose of this project was to get exposed to different engineering tools, such as Solidworks (CAD software), CNC routing, basic DC circuits, soldering, and 3D printing.

My personal design goal was to make a lithophane resemebling an Estus flask from the video game series, *Dark Souls*. In the game, it is a bottle of liquid fire, which I thought fit well with the theme of light.

**CNC**
A basic model of a the base, top, and circuit were modeled in Solidworks then prepped in VCarve. The top and base were CNC'd from wood, and the circuit from a copper plate.

**Soldering**
The LED unit, resistor, and potentiometer were soldered into the appropriate places on the circuit.

**3D Printing**
First, a basic cylinder was modeled with a marble/rock texture height mapped on it to mimic the cracked an rugged texture of an Estus flask.

I then created another model after the shape of an Estus flask. This model had to broken up into two parts to avoid any overhanging issues: the upper bottleneck and the main body of the flask.

The cyclinder printed in the white PLA allowed for good passage of light through the lithophane. However, the bronze color PLA did not allow as much light through, but it still worked well enough in the dark.
