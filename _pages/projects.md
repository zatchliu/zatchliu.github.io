This project takes a data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jmpark746/pga-tour-data-2010-2018) on PGA Tour Data from 2010-2018. Using the dataset, a series of Data Visuliazations were made using R. The visulizations specifically look at the effect of driving distance on success on the PGA Tour.
