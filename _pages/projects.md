[**Egg Hatcher**](https://github.com/zatchliu/Egg_Hatcher)

Egg Hatcher is based off [The Button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Button_(Reddit)). The website displays a chicken and two buttons. One button has the chicken lay an egg, while the other button hatches all the eggs. The goal is to see who can hatch the most eggs at once, but the current number of eggs is unknown. Each player can only hatch one egg every 60 seconds, so there is tension as the player decides if they should lay another egg or hatch all the eggs for themselves. A user can login with a username to keep track of the most eggs they've peronsally hatched. When a player hatches the eggs they will see their scores and the high score.

This project takes a data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jmpark746/pga-tour-data-2010-2018) on PGA Tour Data from 2010-2018. Using the dataset, a series of Data Visuliazations were made using R. The visulizations specifically look at the effect of driving distance on success on the PGA Tour.
