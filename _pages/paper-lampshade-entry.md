The task for this project was to design and construct a paper shade for a wall-mounted light fixture, making a full scale vessel for light to occupy. This design problem is intended to investigate the relationship between form and material - in this case paper - and to study the potential of one proportional system. This problem emphasizes the importance of making in the process of design and of direct experimentation as the basis of study. 

My lampshade was inspired by Kusudama, a type of modular origami. The idea was to have the lampshade to be constructed our of many smaller units, so that there would be some customizable aspect to how the units would be configured together.

The design for the units was based off a modified sonobe unit. Some 'panels' of the unit were removed to reduce the layers of paper in front of the light.

Orignially I used standard copy paper, but I quickly found that the paper was still too think and minimal light was able to pass through. I switched to thinner parchment paper, and iterated on the modified sonobe unit design to further reduce the layers of paper.

Based of feedback, the main task now was to up the scale and create more units to esablished a more full, final form of the lampshade.
